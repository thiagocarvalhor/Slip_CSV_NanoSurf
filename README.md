# Slip_CSV_NanoSurf
Slip .csv with several curves in the same file, plot and calculates the average of the curves

# Curve Plotting and Averaging

This Python script uses the pandas and matplotlib libraries to plot current versus voltage curves from data in a CSV file. It also calculates and plots the average of these curves.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed in your environment.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
    ```

3. Run the Python script, providing the path to the CSV file as an argument.

4. The script will display a graph containing all individual curves and the average.

## Customization

- The code provides basic customization options, such as colors and line widths for the curves.
- Modify the script as needed to fit your specific requirements.
